# STAR Dataset Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) dataset, a large-scale educational experiment conducted in Tennessee. The analysis focuses on evaluating the impact of class size on student performance and investigates the randomization of treatment and control groups.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

* Assess the effectiveness of small class sizes in improving student test scores.
* Analyze the balance of covariates to evaluate the effectiveness of randomization.
* Quantify the impact of treatment through regression analysis while controlling for confounding variables.
* Explore race and teacher experience as determinants of student performance.

## Dataset Description
The STAR dataset consists of 5,786 observations and 19 variables. Key variables used in the analysis include:

* Test Score: Students' total scores on standardized tests.
* Class Size: Treatment indicator for small classes (small = 1) vs. regular classes (small = 0).
* Gender: Binary indicator (male = 1, female = 0).
* Free Lunch: Binary indicator for eligibility for free/reduced lunch.
* Race: Categorized as White/Asian or Black.
* Teacher Experience: Years of teaching experience.

## Key Insights
### Effectiveness of Small Classes:
* Students in small classes scored on average 13.55 to 14.31 points higher on standardized tests compared to those in regular-sized classes.

### Regression Analysis:
* Regression models confirmed the positive impact of smaller class sizes on test scores, even after adjusting for other variables.
* The significance of certain covariates, such as eligibility for free lunch, highlighted socioeconomic disparities in academic outcomes.

### Covariate Analysis:
* Covariates such as gender, race, free lunch status, and teacher experience were analyzed to assess randomization balance.
* Teacher experience was identified as unbalanced and was incorporated as a control variable in regression models.
* The relationship between teacher experience and test scores was found to be weak and highly dispersed across racial groups.

## Getting Started
